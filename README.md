# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-TensorFlow
Object detection is a computer vision technique in which a software system can detect, locate, and trace the object from a given image or video. Tensorflow bundles together Machine Learning and Deep Learning models and algorithms. And it allows developers to create a graph of computations to perform. Each node in the graph represents a mathematical operation and each connection represents data. Hence, instead of dealing with low-details like figuring out proper ways to hitch the output of one function to the input of another, the developer can focus on the overall logic of the application. Creating accurate Machine Learning Models which are capable of identifying and localizing multiple objects in a single image remained a core challenge in computer vision. But, with recent advancements in Deep Learning, Object Detection applications are easier to develop than ever before. TensorFlowâ€™s Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models.
