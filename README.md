# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-TensorFlow
Object detection is a computer vision technique in which a software system can detect, locate, and trace the object from a given image or video. Tensorflow bundles together Machine Learning and Deep Learning models and algorithms. Creating accurate Machine Learning Models which are capable of identifying and localizing multiple objects in a single image remained a core challenge in computer vision. But, with recent advancements in Deep Learning, Object Detection applications are easier to develop than ever before.
